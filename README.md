# Python

Hello All,
I was given two csv input files containing some data.
Firstly, I removed unwanted texts from the csv file, and then used pandas data frame to obtain the output files asked.
I have made two files Individual and TeamWise Python Jupyter files.
After successfully running Individual Python File, it prints the Rankings of Individual Members as like in the output asked and creates excel file named Individual Leaderboard
After running TeamWise Python File, it prints the Rankings of Teams as like in the output asked and creates excel file named Team Wise Leaderboard.
